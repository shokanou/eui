##### Information about the project
Body Music Control is a game that encourages its users to move and come together by letting them interact with music through movement. One to three Android smart devices are used, of which the acceleration of usersâ€™ movement is gathered and used to modify certain factors of the music. The users control the pitch and volume of the music, as well as the volume of noise applied to the music. Several game options are possible.
